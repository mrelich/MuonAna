2015-09-08 Matt:
	* using np.sqrt to take sqrt of numpy array (thanks Takao!)
	* Adding ability to save output for atmospheric weighted data
	* Adding lower energy data to saved output
	* Adding plotting script to plot any variables we save
	* Updating MyPlots to plot a series of data
		Note: Maybe this should be handled differently... as in only plots one dataset.
		that is more generic.  Go with this for now... deadlines :O

2015-09-07 Matt:
	* Adding error bar plotting function
	* Adding ability to write output to a root tree
	* Fixing weight saved in savedata from SaveInfo.py. Didn't include sf before

2015-09-04 Matt:
	* Committing n-1 check for variables
	* Updating variable list -- TODO: understand dark percentage or remove it!

2015-09-01 Matt:
	* Updating Options.py adding specific bdt options which will be good for testing
	* Updating gridsearch to include 6 cores by default
	* Updating All scripts that are dependent on Options.py

2015-08-27 Matt:
	* Fixing how samples are split so that weighting makes sense
	* Adding Evaluation.py which will plot the bdt score for evaluated data
	* Adding PlotEffArea.py which is untested and sloppy..
	* Adding SaveInfo.py which will save models and write output to trees.  The trees part
		isn't implemented yet
	* Committing some updates where I commented things out in TMVATest.py
	* Update to MyData.py keeping some variables needed to plot Eff Area.
		Updated getDataNoWeight method

2015-08-26 Matt:
	* Adding master.py to run a variety of options
	* Adding TMVATest.py which will generate basic plots used for validation in TMVA
	* Adding Tools.py to clean up master.py
	* Adding Validation.py to do the cross-validation once a parameter set has been chosen
	* Adding GridSearch.py to perform a search for best hyper-parameters
	* Adding a setup directory script so I can take this code to other machines and create
		the same directory structure

2015-08-25 Matt:
	* Adding directory structure
	* Committing first round of scripts
